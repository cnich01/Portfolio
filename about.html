                <!-- It is important for prospective employers to find out who you are,
                so your computer science portfolio should include some personal details. 
                Even though your personal brand takes time to develop, it is an asset 
                you must nurture if you want your career to evolve.-->
                <p>
                    I am a recent computer science graduate from Oklahoma City University with one year 
                    of hands-on experience in computer repair and troubleshooting. As a new graduate, I 
                    have an educational background in front-end, object-oriented, and web programming.  
                    I am highly determined, motivated, creative, and passionate about creating software 
                    that will help people and/or bring them joy. I enjoy combining front-end development and
                    graphics together to watch software come to life. In my free time, I enjoy making 
                    and playing video games, designing websites, and drawing.

                    <b>Oklahoma TSA Video Game Design State Competition - 3rd Place</b>
                        <span class="right"><i>2018</i></span><br>

                            The Technology Student Association hosts a video game design competition with a different theme every year. 
                            In 2018, the theme was a TSA-themed sports game. My team and I created an archery puzzle game that featured 
                            point and click mechanics and an interactive environment that the player could use to their advantage. The game 
                            took place in an archey-themed escape room, with teh player being prompted to test out TSA Laboratory's bow and arrow 
                            technology. The game had a running score as you solved challenges and featured a bonus room that needed to be completed 
                            in order to obtain the maximum score. The game ended when the player completed all of the challenges and escaped the lab. 
                            We placed first in many local competitions, but ended up placing third in the Oklahoma State Conference.

                            jumpman mechanics and multiple unique enemies that the player had to defeat. The game was set in a mad scientist's 
                            lab, and the enemies were all of his hybrid animal creations. The game ended when you eithe rran out of lives or
                            defeated the mad scientist. We placed first in many local competitions, but ended up placing third in the Oklahoma 
                            State Conference.
