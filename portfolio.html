                <h3>Oklahoma City University GPS System</h3>
                    <p>As a senior capstone project, I challenge my knowledge and abilities to learn new skills. 
                        For example, I learned the language Kotlin.  In a team environment, I was one of three people 
                        that created and designed a GPS app for the Oklahoma City University campus.  When developing the 
                        idea for this capstone I knew there was a significant need for this application, especially for new 
                        students and transfer students as the campus was built in 1904 and is difficult to navigate due 
                        to many renovations throughout the years.  This app was created by manually creating paths for 
                        the sidewalks as they were not mapped in Google Maps API. </p>
