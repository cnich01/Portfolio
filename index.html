                    <h3>Oklahoma City University GPS System</h3>
                        <p>As a senior capstone project, I challenged my knowledge and abilities to learn new skills. 
                        For example, I learned the language Kotlin.  In a team environment, I was one of three people 
                        that created and designed a GPS app for the Oklahoma City University campus.  When developing the 
                        idea for this capstone I knew there was a significant need for this application, especially for new 
                        students and transfer students as the campus was built in 1904 and is difficult to navigate due 
                        to many renovations throughout the years.  This app was created by manually creating paths for 
                        the sidewalks as they were not mapped in Google Maps API. </p>

                    <h3>Job Application Checker</h3>
                        <p>As a final project for my software engineering class, my team and I decided to create a job application checker app using
                        Java and JavaFX. I worked in a team of two people to design, implement, test, and code the project. Each
                        step had a deadline that we had to make sure to finish by. In the end, we were able to finish before each
                        deadline to create a working job application checker. The project is very simple, but creates a good baseline for 
                        a more intricate and detailed application later.</p>

                        <p>As a team project for my game programming class, my team and I decided to create a space themed platformer 
                        game using Unity. I worked in a team of three people to create a 2D platformer game with shooting mechanics. 
                        We had a strict deadline that we had to make sure to finish by, and we had to create a presentation to show to 
                        our class. In the end, we were able to finish well before the deadline to create a fun little platformer.</p>
